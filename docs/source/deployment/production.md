# Production Considerations

This page covers operational guidance for running the AI-Q blueprint in production environments.

## Database

### Use Managed PostgreSQL

The default compose stack includes a PostgreSQL container, but for production workloads consider a managed database service:

- Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL

Set the following environment variables to point to your managed database:

| Variable | Driver | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `NAT_JOB_STORE_DB_URL` | `asyncpg` | `postgresql+asyncpg://<user>:<pw>@rds-host:5432/aiq_jobs` |
| `AIQ_CHECKPOINT_DB` | `psycopg2` | `postgresql://<user>:<pw>@rds-host:5432/aiq_checkpoints` |
| `AIQ_SUMMARY_DB` | `psycopg` | `postgresql+psycopg://<user>:<pw>@rds-host:5432/aiq_jobs` |

### Database Initialization

When using a managed database, you must run the initialization SQL manually (or as a migration step) since the `init-db.sql` Docker entrypoint script only executes on a fresh PostgreSQL container volume. The script:

1. Creates the `aiq_checkpoints` database.
2. Grants permissions to the application user.
3. Creates the job metadata, access-control, admission, event, and
   document-summary tables with their indices in `aiq_jobs`.

Refer to `deploy/compose/init-db.sql` for the full schema.

### Backup Strategy

Back up the following databases regularly:

- **`aiq_jobs`** -- Contains the `job_info` table (job metadata) and `job_events` table (event stream). This is the critical operational data store. The shipped Helm profile also points `AIQ_CHECKPOINT_DB` here.
- **`aiq_checkpoints`** -- Contains [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview) agent state checkpoints in the shipped Compose profile and the managed-database example above. These allow resumption of interrupted research workflows.

Back up both databases for either deployment profile. Do not change `AIQ_CHECKPOINT_DB` on an existing deployment
without migrating its checkpoint tables; doing so makes existing resumable workflow state unavailable to the
application.

The two dumps are separate PostgreSQL snapshots. Before running the commands below, pause the API, workers, and any
other writers to either database. Resume them only after both final archives have been published; this defines the
shared recovery point for the backup set.

For managed databases, enable automated daily backups with at least 7 days of retention. For self-managed PostgreSQL,
install PostgreSQL client tools on the backup host and run `pg_dump` on a schedule.

The shipped Compose stack already includes the matching PostgreSQL client tools in its `aiq-postgres` container. Set
`AIQ_BACKUP_DIR` to an absolute path outside the repository, and create portable custom-format archives there without
requiring `pg_dump` on the host:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${AIQ_BACKUP_DIR:?Set AIQ_BACKUP_DIR to an absolute path outside the repository}"
: "${AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER:=aiq-postgres}"
umask 077
install -d -m 0700 "$AIQ_BACKUP_DIR"
backup_id="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-$$-${RANDOM}"
jobs_archive="$AIQ_BACKUP_DIR/aiq_jobs_${backup_id}.dump"
checkpoints_archive="$AIQ_BACKUP_DIR/aiq_checkpoints_${backup_id}.dump"
if [[ -e "$jobs_archive" || -e "$checkpoints_archive" ]]; then
  echo "Refusing to replace an existing backup set: $backup_id" >&2
  exit 1
fi
backup_complete=0
jobs_tmp=
checkpoints_tmp=
cleanup() {
  local exit_status=$?
  if [[ -n "$jobs_tmp" ]]; then
    rm -f -- "$jobs_tmp" || true
  fi
  if [[ -n "$checkpoints_tmp" ]]; then
    rm -f -- "$checkpoints_tmp" || true
  fi
  if (( ! backup_complete )); then
    rm -f -- "$jobs_archive" "$checkpoints_archive" || true
  fi
  return "$exit_status"
}
trap cleanup EXIT
jobs_tmp=$(mktemp "$AIQ_BACKUP_DIR/.aiq_jobs_${backup_id}.XXXXXXXX.dump.tmp")
checkpoints_tmp=$(mktemp "$AIQ_BACKUP_DIR/.aiq_checkpoints_${backup_id}.XXXXXXXX.dump.tmp")

docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" \
  pg_dump --format=custom --no-owner --no-privileges -U aiq -d aiq_jobs \
  > "$jobs_tmp"
docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" \
  pg_dump --format=custom --no-owner --no-privileges -U aiq -d aiq_checkpoints \
  > "$checkpoints_tmp"

mv "$jobs_tmp" "$jobs_archive"
mv "$checkpoints_tmp" "$checkpoints_archive"
backup_complete=1
trap - EXIT
```

If the block exits unsuccessfully, its cleanup trap removes temporary files and any partially published backup set.
Confirm that no archives with that backup ID remain, resume the paused writers, investigate the failure, and use a new
backup ID on the next scheduled run or retry.

If the Compose container name was customized, set `AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER` to that container name.

Treat these archives as sensitive data. Before copying them to backup storage, encrypt them with an
organization-approved backup system, protect transfers in transit, keep encryption keys separate from the archives,
and restrict read and restore access to the required operators and service identities.

Do not wait for an incident to test restoration. On an isolated restore environment, retrieve and decrypt the archives
into a restricted directory, set `AIQ_BACKUP_DIR` to that directory, create disposable databases, restore both archives
with `--exit-on-error`, and inspect their tables. The following example verifies the local Compose archives; replace
`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-PID-RANDOM` with the shared backup ID in the two archive names:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
: "${AIQ_BACKUP_DIR:?Set AIQ_BACKUP_DIR to the restricted archive directory}"
: "${AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER:=aiq-postgres}"

restore_cleanup() {
  local exit_status=$?
  docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -U aiq -d postgres \
    -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS aiq_jobs_restore_check' || true
  docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -U aiq -d postgres \
    -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS aiq_checkpoints_restore_check' || true
  return "$exit_status"
}
trap restore_cleanup EXIT

docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U aiq -d postgres \
  -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS aiq_jobs_restore_check'
docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U aiq -d postgres \
  -c 'CREATE DATABASE aiq_jobs_restore_check'
docker exec -i "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" \
  pg_restore --exit-on-error -U aiq -d aiq_jobs_restore_check \
  < "$AIQ_BACKUP_DIR/aiq_jobs_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-PID-RANDOM.dump"
docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -U aiq -d aiq_jobs_restore_check -c '\dt'

docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U aiq -d postgres \
  -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS aiq_checkpoints_restore_check'
docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U aiq -d postgres \
  -c 'CREATE DATABASE aiq_checkpoints_restore_check'
docker exec -i "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" \
  pg_restore --exit-on-error -U aiq -d aiq_checkpoints_restore_check \
  < "$AIQ_BACKUP_DIR/aiq_checkpoints_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-PID-RANDOM.dump"
docker exec "$AIQ_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" psql -U aiq -d aiq_checkpoints_restore_check -c '\dt'
```

Keep restore testing isolated from a live deployment so the application cannot write to the databases during the
check.

## Artifact Storage

Keep artifact metadata in PostgreSQL and use S3-compatible object storage for artifact
bytes in production. SQL BLOB storage remains the default when the provider is unset.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `AIQ_ARTIFACT_BLOB_PROVIDER` | No | `sql` by default; set to `s3` for object storage. |
| `AIQ_ARTIFACT_S3_BUCKET` | With S3 | Destination bucket. |
| `AIQ_ARTIFACT_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` | No | Leave unset for AWS S3; set for MinIO, Ceph, R2, or another compatible endpoint. |
| `AIQ_ARTIFACT_S3_REGION` | No | S3 region when required by the provider. |
| `AIQ_ARTIFACT_S3_PREFIX` | No | Object-key prefix; defaults to `artifacts/v1`. |

Configure credentials through workload identity, deployment secrets, or the standard
AWS credential chain. When the provider is `s3`, artifact bytes are stored in the
configured bucket and SQL stores artifact metadata only.

### S3 Security Responsibility

The S3-compatible artifact store is operator-managed infrastructure. AI-Q authorizes
artifact access through its API, but those checks do not protect direct access to the
bucket. AI-Q also does not apply application-level encryption to artifact blob bytes
before uploading them. Production operators are therefore responsible for configuring
the object store to:

- use workload identity, an instance profile, or an IAM role for service accounts
  instead of long-lived static access keys;
- restrict `GetObject`, `PutObject`, and `DeleteObject` to the AI-Q worker role and
  the configured bucket and prefix;
- block public access and deny requests that do not use TLS;
- enable provider-managed encryption at rest, such as Amazon S3 SSE-KMS, using a key
  policy restricted to the AI-Q worker role; and
- enable object-access audit logs and credential-usage monitoring.

For non-AWS S3-compatible services, configure equivalent identity, bucket-policy,
transport-encryption, storage-encryption, and audit controls. Static access keys are
appropriate only for local development services such as MinIO and must not be used for
production artifact storage.

## Scaling

### Horizontal Backend Scaling

The shipped Docker Compose topology supports one backend instance. Do not use
Compose service scaling for production because the stack does not provide the
required backend load balancer or shared scheduler topology.

For production horizontal scaling, deploy with Helm and set
`aiq.apps.backend.replicas` or the `aiq.apps.backend.autoscaling` values. Refer
to [Kubernetes and Helm](./kubernetes.md) for the supported deployment path.

Each backend replica starts its own embedded Dask scheduler and worker.
The shipped container entrypoint always creates that embedded cluster. A deployment
that uses a shared Dask cluster must provide a custom entrypoint (for example,
starting `/app/deploy/start_web.py` directly), set
`NAT_DASK_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS` for the web process, and deploy the scheduler
separately.

The embedded scheduler, scheduler dashboard, and worker RPC and diagnostics
listeners bind to `127.0.0.1` and are reachable only within the backend's network
namespace (the same pod when sidecars share its network). An external Dask cluster is
operator-managed infrastructure: place it on a private network, restrict scheduler and
worker ports to the required identities with firewall or NetworkPolicy rules, and
configure Dask TLS. Never expose an unauthenticated scheduler or worker to a shared or
untrusted network.

### Dask Workers

Each backend container runs an embedded Dask scheduler with a configurable number of workers and threads:

| Variable | Default | Guidance |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `DASK_NWORKERS` | `1` | Increase for higher job throughput. Each worker consumes memory proportional to the research workflow depth. |
| `DASK_NTHREADS` | `4` | Increase for I/O-bound workloads (web searches, API calls). |

### Resource Requirements

Deep research workflows are memory- and compute-intensive due to multi-phase LLM calls. Recommended minimums:

| Component | CPU | Memory | Notes |
|-----------|-----|--------|-------|
| Backend | 2 cores | 4 GB | Increase for deep research or multiple concurrent users. |
| Frontend | 0.5 cores | 512 MB | Lightweight [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) server. |
| PostgreSQL | 1 core | 2 GB | Increase for high write throughput. |

### Deep-Research Admission Control

Every asynchronous deep-research submission, including jobs launched from chat,
passes through a database-backed admission gate before Dask enqueue. The gate is
default-on and fails closed when it cannot make a safe database decision. PostgreSQL
deployments serialize decisions across backend replicas with a transaction-scoped
advisory lock; SQLite serializes writers with an immediate transaction.

| Variable | Default | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `AIQ_MAX_DEEP_RESEARCH_INPUT_CHARS` | `32768` | Maximum query payload accepted at admission. It may be lowered; higher values are clamped to the hard per-job contract. |
| `AIQ_MAX_ACTIVE_DEEP_RESEARCH_JOBS_PER_PRINCIPAL` | `5` | Maximum active deep-research jobs for one principal. |
| `AIQ_MAX_ACTIVE_DEEP_RESEARCH_JOBS_GLOBAL` | `50` | Deployment-wide active-job ceiling protecting shared Dask capacity. |
| `AIQ_MAX_DEEP_RESEARCH_SUBMISSIONS_PER_MINUTE` | `20` | Accepted deep-research submissions per principal in a rolling 60-second window. |

Missing, non-integer, zero, or negative values use the safe defaults; these controls
cannot be disabled with `0`. A per-principal capacity or rate rejection returns HTTP
`429`; deployment capacity or admission-store unavailability returns `503`. Capacity
and rate responses include `Retry-After`.

With `REQUIRE_AUTH=true`, the quota key is the verified principal's authentication
type and subject. With `REQUIRE_AUTH=false`, caller-supplied owner text is not trusted
as an identity: all callers share one anonymous admission budget. This prevents owner
rotation from bypassing limits, but it is not tenant isolation. Shared or multi-user
deployments must enable authentication as described below.

### Deep-Research Job Budgets and Provider Quotas

`deep_research_agent.resource_limits` applies non-disableable per-job ceilings
to combined query and clarification input, graph execution time, serialized
plans and final reports, aggregate shared-state file count and bytes, query
count and text, serialized research notes, orchestrator todos, and AI-Q
source-tool attempts and concrete batch items. Defaults are also absolute
maximums; deployments may configure lower values but cannot raise them. The
20-query ceiling also caps persisted notes at 20 because each accepted query
can return at most one `ResearchNotes` file. Researchers cannot write
`/shared/**` directly; the parent batch tool validates and persists their
returned notes.

The source-tool call counter is job-local defense in depth. It is created for
one agent run, inherited by that run's concurrent researcher tasks, and reset
when the run ends. It is **not** a distributed requests-per-minute, token,
spend, or daily-account quota across Dask processes, workers, backend replicas,
or other clients using the same provider credentials. It also cannot count
retries performed internally by a provider SDK.

Production operators remain responsible for provider-account and deployment-wide
controls:

- enforce requests-per-minute, tokens-per-minute, daily usage, and spend limits
  in the provider account, an API gateway, or a shared Redis/database limiter;
- use separate least-privilege credentials and quota pools for production,
  development, and unrelated services;
- alert on quota consumption, HTTP 429 responses, provider error rates, and
  anomalous source-call volume; and
- capacity-plan concurrency below provider limits rather than relying on
  retries after throttling.

Do not use the job-local counter as a substitute for a deployment-wide provider
quota. A production deployment needs an operator-owned distributed limiter or
provider-enforced quota in addition to the per-job defense.

## Security

### Authentication Boundary

The default `REQUIRE_AUTH=false` mode is for a single trusted user or trust domain;
it does not isolate jobs, documents, reports, or artifacts between callers. Do not
publish a no-auth deployment on a shared or untrusted network. Multi-user or externally
reachable deployments must follow the [Authentication](./authentication.md) guide or
place AI-Q behind a customer-managed authenticated gateway with authorization, network
isolation, and edge request limits.

### Non-Root Execution

The Docker image runs as a non-root user (`aiq`, UID 1000) in both dev and release targets. The NVIDIA distroless base image has no shell and no package manager, reducing the attack surface.

### Read-Only Configuration Mounts

The compose stack mounts `configs/` as read-only (`:ro`), preventing the application from modifying its own configuration at runtime.

### Secrets Management

Store API keys in `deploy/.env` and ensure the file is not committed to version control (it is listed in `.gitignore`). Never embed keys in configuration files or Dockerfiles.

### Sandbox Runtime Ownership

Treat optional sandbox runtimes as separate execution and authentication boundaries.
Production OpenShell requires an explicitly owned authenticated gateway, a distinct
policy-bound sandbox per job, verified terminal cleanup, and hard Landlock enforcement.
Follow the [Linux production acceptance](./openshell.md#linux-production-acceptance)
and [policy/config pairing](./openshell.md#policy-and-ai-q-config-pairing) contracts;
do not infer production readiness from a macOS best-effort demo.

## Monitoring

### Liveness and Readiness Endpoints

The backend exposes separate probe endpoints:

- `/live` checks only that the API process can respond. Use it for liveness probes.
- `/health` checks database and content-encryption dependencies. Use it for readiness probes.

This separation keeps a temporary dependency outage from restarting a live API process while still removing an
unready instance from service traffic.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/live
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Log Tailing

Backend logs show agent execution, tool calls, LLM interactions, and job lifecycle events.

```bash
docker logs aiq-agent -f
```

Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for verbose output during troubleshooting. Use `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` in production to reduce log volume.

### Tracing

The backend exports NeMo Relay traces to OpenTelemetry-compatible destinations.
See [Observability](./observability.md) for ATOF, Phoenix OTEL, pricing, and
privacy-redaction guidance.

If you are deploying the `aiq_api` front-end and want request correlation on
Relay-exported spans, set the relevant environment variables at deploy time rather
than hardcoding them in code:

- `AIQ_TRACE_USER_IDENTITY_MODE`
- `AIQ_TRACE_USER_IDENTITY_HMAC_SECRET`
- `AIQ_TRACE_CLIENT_ID_MODE`
- `AIQ_TRACE_CLIENT_ID_HMAC_SECRET`
- `AIQ_TRACE_CLIENT_IP_HEADERS`

### Metrics to Watch

| Metric | Source | What to look for |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Backend response time | Health endpoint, access logs | Increasing latency indicates resource pressure or LLM API slowdowns. |
| Job queue depth | `job_info` table (`status='pending'`) | Growing backlog means Dask workers cannot keep up. |
| Database connections | PostgreSQL `pg_stat_activity` | Connection exhaustion from too many backend replicas. |
| Container restarts | Docker | Frequent restarts indicate OOM kills or startup failures. |
| Dask worker memory | Exported Dask metrics, or the loopback-only dashboard inspected from inside the backend container through an approved access path | Memory growth in workers during deep research. Do not publish port 8787 on a shared or untrusted network. |
