Clarifier agent for interactive clarification dialog.

This module provides the ClarifierAgent class which handles multi-turn
clarification dialogs with users before deep research begins. The agent
uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration and supports tool calling
for context gathering.

Example:
    >>> from aiq_agent.agents.clarifier_agent import ClarifierAgent
    >>> from aiq_agent.common import LLMProvider
    >>>
    >>> async def prompt_user(question: str) -> str:
    ...     return input(question)
    >>>
    >>> provider = LLMProvider()
    >>> provider.set_default(my_llm)
    >>> agent = ClarifierAgent(
    ...     llm_provider=provider,
    ...     user_prompt_callback=prompt_user,
    ... )

    Clarifier agent for interactive clarification dialog.

    This agent handles interactive clarification dialogs for deep research queries.
    It asks follow-up questions to refine the research scope, constraints, and
    requirements before the actual research begins.

    The agent uses LangGraph for workflow orchestration with three main nodes:
    - agent: Generates clarification questions using the LLM
    - tools: Executes tool calls for context gathering (e.g., web search)
    - ask_for_clarification: Prompts the user and processes their response

    It gathers context and, when the request is vague, may clarify the scope or
    the type of output the user wants (e.g. report, table, comparison, prediction)
    before research begins. It does not produce or approve a research plan.

    Attributes:
        llm_provider: Provider for obtaining LLM instances.
        tools: List of tools available for context gathering.
        user_prompt_callback: Async callback for prompting user input.
        max_turns: Maximum number of Q&A turns before auto-completing.
        system_prompt: The loaded system prompt for the LLM.
        callbacks: LangChain callbacks for tracing/logging.

    Example:
        >>> async def user_prompt_fn(question: str) -> str:
        ...     return input(question)
        >>>
        >>> provider = LLMProvider()
