        typed as a single nested model as a JSON string -- the whole object serialized once more,
        quotes and all -- instead of as an object, while emitting sibling list-of-object fields in
        the same payload correctly. The

        the structured-output retry guard, an unbounded retry loop -- into a first-attempt

        * a ``json.loads`` failure leaves the value alone rather than being swallowed, keeping
          cases such as a whole plan packed into one string a visible, capped failure.

        ``extra="forbid"`` is unaffected: this runs before it and never adds keys.
