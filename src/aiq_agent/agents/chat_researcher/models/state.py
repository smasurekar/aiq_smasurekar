    State for the main chat researcher workflow graph.

    Attributes:
        messages: Conversation history with LangGraph message reducer.
        user_info: Optional user information for personalization.
        data_sources: Optional list of user-selected data source IDs.
        database_name: Optional validated GSF database scope for this request.
        user_intent: Result of intent classification.
        depth_decision: Result of depth routing.
        final_report: The final research report.
        shallow_result: Result from shallow research (if executed).
        clarifier_result: Log from clarifier agent dialog.
        original_query: The latest user query, preserved for deep research.
        available_documents: User-uploaded documents with summaries for context.
        skip_clarifier: When True the clarifier node is bypassed regardless of
            ``enable_clarifier``.  Set automatically for API-key and anonymous
            callers so headless workflows do not stall waiting for user input.
        active_report_job_id: Identifier of the active asynchronous report used
            for report follow-up turns.
        catalog_context: Validated catalog routing result supplied to hybrid
            research; reset at each turn boundary.
        catalog_request_id: Request identifier associated with
            ``catalog_context``; reset at each turn boundary.
        last_report_markdown: Most recent report produced inline, retained
            across turns for report follow-up when no report job is available.
        workflow_outcome: Explicit terminal workflow failure when a node
            degrades an exception to fallback text; reset at each turn boundary.
